# 2021 Advent of Code problems

This year, I'm trying to learn Rust (again!) and using AoC as an excuse to do
it.

### Running challenges
```
cargo run --bin day1a inputs/1a.txt
```

### Required Rust version
Days 1-17 were tested with Rust 1.56. Days 19+ were tested with Rust 1.57. An
early version of Day 18 required Rust 1.59 (nightly, at the time of writing) for
a destructuring assignment.

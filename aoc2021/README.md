# 2021 Advent of Code problems

This year, I'm trying to learn Rust (again!) and using AoC as an excuse to do
it.

### Running challenges
```
cargo run --bin day1a inputs/1a.txt
```

### Required Rust version
In general, I've been running with Rust 1.56. Day 18 requires Rust nightly for a
destructuring assignment. Days 19+ were tested with Rust 1.57.
